# GAN-MNIST-Image-Generator
This repository contains a TensorFlow/Keras implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) designed to generate images resembling handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The project aims to explore and demonstrate the capabilities of GANs in generating new, realistic images based on a training set of handwritten digits
